# Linux Challenge

This challenge will help you practice the commands we have seen so far and introduce you to new ones.

Tasks:

Display the content of the /etc/passwd file, count the number of lines, and sort the output in descending order (z-a).

Find your User ID (UID) and Group ID (GID) from the /etc/passwd file without displaying the entire file's content.

List hidden files and directories in the current working directory ($pwd) sorted by time (use the man page to find the appropriate flag).

Create a file named myfile and set its permissions so that only you can read, write, and execute it.

Create five files named f1, f2, ..., f5 using a single command without typing touch five times.

Move to a different location where the five files created in Task 5 do not exist. Then, search for those files and execute the ls -l command for each file using a single command.

Create the directory path d1/d2/d3/foo/d4. If the parent directories do not exist, they should be created automatically.

Replace all occurrences of the standalone number "5" with the word "five" in the following text: "We have 5 days to finish 5 lines of code of the Hi5b project".

List all running processes on your system and sort them by the username associated with each process.

Launch the gedit program, find its PID, and send it a signal to terminate it. Then, send another signal to resume its execution.

Install the SSH server, start the service, and check its status. If the service is not enabled, enable it.

Display the network interfaces on your system. Identify a non-physical interface and explain its purpose.

Determine your IP and MAC addresses.

Test whether you can communicate outside your private network using a command.

Describe the fate of a packet destined for a host outside of your network.

Determine the IP address of your gateway(s) using two different commands.

Trace the route taken to connect to cloudflare.com.

Find the IP address of perficient.com and its mail server.

List all TCP and UDP connections on your system.

Identify the ports open on your system.

List only the listening connections on your system.
